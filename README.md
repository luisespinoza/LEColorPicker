LEColorPicker
=============

A Cocoa-Touch system for getting a color scheme in function of an image, like iTunes 11 does. It is designed as a general purpose class set, in wich  LEColorPicker is the interface for your client code.

At is this moment, still needs a lot of work, and the colors sets are not exactly Itunes sets. 

Suggestions will be well received, and check this periodically to know the updates.

* Drag the 'LEColorPickerDemo/LEColorPicker' folder into your project, and you are done.

## Usage
LEColorPicker class provides a class method that receives an UIImage as input and completition block that is executed when the image processing is done. The completion block recieves a NSDictionary with the three computed colors. The computation take some time, that is why we provide this split phase method.



	#import "LEColorPicker.h"
	...
    [LEColorPicker pickColorFromImage:image onComplete:^(NSDictionary *colorsPickedDictionary) {
        _outputView.backgroundColor = [colorsPickedDictionary objectForKey:@"BackgroundColor"];
        _titleTextField.textColor = [colorsPickedDictionary objectForKey:@"PrimaryTextColor"];
        _bodyTextField.textColor = [colorsPickedDictionary objectForKey:@"SecondaryTextColor"];
    }];
	...
	

## About the sample images
All images are public domain. If you want to add your own testing images, drag the image to the Resources folder of the project, in Xcode. Don't use names with "Default" or will be filtered.
